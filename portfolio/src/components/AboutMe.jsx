                <h2>Full-Stack Web Developer</h2>
                <p>I have a passion for tech, video games and creating fun and user-friendly apps. I'm always improving my skills 
                    to make the best apps I can and would love to join a team that is equally driven. When I'm not coding, I'm most likely
                    eating chipotle with my girlfriend or walking my super hyper Boston Terrier.
                    If you're interesting in collabolarating on a project or just want to contact me, you can contact me and see my
                    resume via the icons of the left. Thanks for checking out my work!
